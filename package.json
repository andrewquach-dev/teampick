  "description": "Tool that makes it easier to decide teams randomly. I play a lot of pick up basketball and it can sometimes get a little old having all the shooters on one team when we \"shoot for teams\" or be the last person picked ðŸ˜”. Hopefully this tool can be of use to other pickup basketball players or even for anyone who just needs 2 randomized teams.",
